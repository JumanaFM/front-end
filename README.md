# front-end
[Blog](https://jumanafm.github.io/front-end/)

For this work I challenged myself to design a responsive design without using media query! :D and I did it! Responsive webpages without media query! 

Images used in this work are from the web and are only used for the purposes of this project and will be replaced if I make my website public.
